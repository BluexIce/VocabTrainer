# VocabTrainer

built with the Python Kivy/MD Framework 

This is a side-project currently developed by one person.

*This App is currently in v0.90*

## Attention

- I am developing this program in my free time, so commits may vary wildly

- I´m currently working on an Android APK of this version. Right now it works under Linux and Windows 10. All you need is python3 and kivyMD.

- A file to show how to compile it for Android will follow in the near future.
