Python Kivy 

This is a side-project currently developed by one person.

This App is in v0.11

##Attention##

IÂ´m currently working on an Android APK of this version. Right now it works under Linux and Windows 10. All you need is python3 and kivy.

A file to show how to compile it for Android will follow.
I am developing this program in my free time, so commits may vary wildly



It`s aim is to help me learn a language I want to focus on
