# VocabTrainer

built with the Python Kivy/MD Framework 

This is a side-project currently developed by one person.

*This App is currently in v0.91*

## Attention

- I am developing this program in my free time, so commits may vary wildly

- IÂ´m currently working on an Android APK of this version. Right now it works under Linux and Windows 10. All you need is python3 and kivyMD.

- A file to show how to compile it for Android will follow in the near future. (with a buildozer apk file in this repository)

# My Goal with this App(lication)

--> was and still is to emphasize the learning process of learing a new language. And more control over what you want to learn.

- With this app you are able to define your own vocabulary and change it as you want


# Future Plans

- [x] design a logo
- [ ] develop a version focused on desktops
- [ ] fix content in the android app
- [ ] look into possibilities to add more content to the android app
- [ ] different language support
